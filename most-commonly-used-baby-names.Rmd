Popularity of certain names over others fluctuates depending on the time period. For example, according to the [Social Security Association](https://www.ssa.gov), in 2018 the most popular baby name for males was Liam, however, in 1960, David was the most popular name among male babies.

While the importance of giving a baby an appropriate name has always been known to parents, the definition of what an appropriate name is keeps changing. These changes could be due to a variety of reasons such as: the rise in celebrities giving their babies non-traditional names like Kulture or Blue Ivy, or a preference for gender neutral names. 

With the landscape of baby names rapidly changing, lets look at the most common names now, and how these names have varied in popularity in the past. According to the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/report004.pdf), the number of births in 2017 was 3,853,472, which was down 2% from 2016 and the lowest number in 30 years. The most popular names given to these babies are shown bellow.

## Most Popular Baby Names in 2017
